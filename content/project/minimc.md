summary = "This is a test library to provide reference implementations of MCMC algorithms and ideas. The basis and reference for much of this library is from Michael Betancourt's wonderful [A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434). The highlight of the library right now is the ~15 line Hamiltonian Monte Carlo implementation (which relies on an 8 line integrator). This is commented and documented, with an aim to be instructive to read."
