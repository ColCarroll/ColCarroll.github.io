summary = "For the [second year in a row](http://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania/leaderboard), I took part in [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/)'s contest to predict [March Madness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship) winners. The [code for the actual model](https://github.com/ColCarroll/march_madness) is not very expository (get in touch if you are interested), but I also built a friendlier page to query predictions interactively at the link."
