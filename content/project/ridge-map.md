summary = "A library for making ridge plots of... ridges. Choose a location, get an elevation map, and tinker with it to make something beautiful. Heavily inspired from Zach Cole's beautiful art, Jake Vanderplas' examples, and Joy Division's 1979 album \"Unknown Pleasures\". Uses `matplotlib`, `SRTM.py`, `numpy`, and `scikit-image` (for lake detection)."
