# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Probabilistic programming libraries like PyMC3, PyStan, and Edward provide flexible ways for users to define Bayesian models, and powerful algorithms for generating samples from the posterior distribution of these models in the presence of observed data. These posterior samples are naturally high dimensional, and each library has a different strategy for handling and inspecting this data. ArviZ is an open source collaboration between PyMC3 and PyStan developers that uses xarray as a common data structure. ArviZ implements common visualization and criticism tasks, useful in making sense of these models."

abstract_short = "ArviZ is a new library for visualization and criticism of Bayesian models. We will show how ArviZ uses xarray to provide an intuitive way to store and query these high dimensional objects. This will be a beautiful visual tour of xarray and the Python probabilistic programming landscape, with examples from PyMC3, PyStan, Edward, Pyro, and TensorFlow Probability."
