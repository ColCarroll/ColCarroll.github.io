# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "ArviZ is a new library for visualization and criticism of Bayesian models. We will show how ArviZ uses xarray to provide an intuitive way to store and query these high dimensional objects. This will be a beautiful visual tour of xarray and the Python probabilistic programming landscape, with examples from PyMC3, PyStan, Edward, Pyro, and TensorFlow Probability."
