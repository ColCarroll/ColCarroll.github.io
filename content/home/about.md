# About Me

I am a software engineer and mathematician in Cambridge, MA, working on machine learning and natural language processing. I am a contributor to the popular [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) library. I received my doctorate studying [geometric measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_measure_theory) with [Dr. Robert Hardt](http://math.rice.edu/~hardt/) at Rice University.

In my spare time [I run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1254248), walk in the woods with Pete the pup, and [launch balloons into [near] space](http://giant.gfycat.com/TenseSkinnyIndianrhinoceros.gif).
