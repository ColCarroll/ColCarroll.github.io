This is also in the "talks" section, but I put a lot of work into it, so want to highlight it.  There is a [github repo](https://github.com/ColCarroll/hamiltonian_monte_carlo_talk) with all the talk materials in it, and it is hosted [as a static page](https://colcarroll.github.io/hamiltonian_monte_carlo_talk/bayes_talk.html) there as well.
