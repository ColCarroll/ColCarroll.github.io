I had thought I was in for a 40 minute talk, but ended up giving a 90 minute workshop on a 
Bayesian approach to linear regression. From a meta sense, this was a lot of work! I am not sure 
I would do another session that was this long. On the other hand, it felt great both that a lot 
of people came to the workshop, and that there were a lot of interesting and useful discussions
about the material afterwards.

Anyways! I spent about a week after the workshop converting my notes and the slides into a series
of three essays. [They can be found here](https://colcarroll.github.io/pydata_nyc2017/), and I 
hope they are useful.
