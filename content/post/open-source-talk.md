A friend of mine is teaching a course on "The Open Source Movement", and invited me to talk about my experience with open source. This is my first non-technical talk, and was quite difficult to prepare! 

It is hosted [as a static page](https://colcarroll.github.io/open_source_pa/) with all the slides.
