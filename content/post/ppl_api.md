I added a [working tour of 9 probabilistic programming languages](https://colcarroll.github.io/ppl-api/) in Python. Code to get it all to run is [here](https://github.com/ColCarroll/ppl-api/blob/master/notebooks/different_ppls.ipynb) (though you are on your own installing all the correct frameworks), and issues/corrections/suggestions are all happily appreciated!
