        <p><span class="newthought">It has been about 6 years</span> since I last made a blog post, so I decided to go
            tidy up my website. I wanted something simple and easy to maintain, that would encourage me to "just
            write", and I did not want to lose all my old material<label for="sn-old-site"
                class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-old-site"
                class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">My first website was <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628041204/http://colindcarroll.com/" target="_blank">on
                    wordpress</a> during grad school, and I still hope to rescue that content someday</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had previously used <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>, a static website generator
            that was hip in 2016. Unfortunately, the theme I had been using seems to have become spammy beyond
            recognition<label for="sn-spammy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
                id="sn-spammy" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a
                    href="https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder" target="_blank">link</a>, but probably don't go
                there</span>. I recall trying to update my version a few years ago, and finding it... difficult<label
                for="sn-difficult" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
                id="sn-difficult" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">I believe the
                advice was to read through the CHANGELOGs one at a time, and I was like 20 versions out of date
                then</span>: at the time I bisected versions of both the theme and the binary until I could at least
            build and deploy the site.
        </p>

        <p>I also no longer liked how the old site looked. Seems like it was time for every software engineer's favorite
            idea until they actually do it: <em>A TOTAL REWRITE</em>.</p>

        <h2>Attempt 1: Lektor</h2>
        <p><span class="newthought">I have been a longtime fan</span> of <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/"
                target="_blank">Armin Ronacher</a>'s projects, recalled he had released some software for blogs<label
                for="sn-lektor" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-lektor"
                class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/"
                    target="_blank">Lektor</a></span> and figured "simple" might mean just laundering
            my decisions through someone whose taste I trusted, and who had thought harder about this.</p>
        <p>At the same time, I was interested in trying out "vibe coding" - my day job is working on reasoning in LLMs,
            but I have not actually used them that often. So I downloaded <a href="https://windsurf.com/"
                target="_blank">WindSurf</a>, started a new Lektor project, and gave it a shot.</p>
        <p><label for="sn-tree" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-tree"
                class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">
                A partial tree of where I got to with porting my website to lektor:
                <img src="/img/lektor_tree.png" height="75%">
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>It went ok at first! I chatted with the LLM about my plan, "we" decided to put my old site in the project
            directory, and it appeared fairly familiar with both Hugo and Lektor formats. The LLM identified a bunch of
            .md files that I needed to port, and it tried running this all through
            <code>pandoc</code>. The files I checked consisted of just a title, so I asked the LLM to grab all the
            metadata (date, author, tags) for me, but it took a long time to do this, and I was manually checking it all
            anyways. Additionally, I gradually realized that I was just moving from markdown to lektor
            files, which each have their own adhoc way of storing metadata before converting everything to html.
        </p>
        <p>After spending about 90 minutes on this, I decided to start over. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Attempt 2: Just ask</h2>
        <p><span class="newthought">At this point I suspected</span> that I wanted to just have html and css, using a
            basic theme. This might have been the most useful thing I got from the LLMs: I wroted down my goals for the
            website, wrote down my current
            thinking <label for="sn-thinking" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
                class="margin-toggle" id="sn-thinking"><span class="sidenote">
                That is, (1) I should keep trying lektor, (2) maybe there is another static site generator I do not know
                about, or (3) I should just use html and css
            </span>
            and then asked for what to do. I got a reasonable answer with positives and negatives, but really had done
            the hard thinking myself while posing the correct question. LLM as a therapist, I guess.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Attempt 3: Static site</h2>
        <p><span class="newthought">I gave porting my old site another go</span>, at this point having 4 variously named
            folders for my website on my computer<label for="sn-names"
                class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"
                id="sn-names"><span class="sidenote">colinweb, web_home, static_site, website</span> for the project.
            WindSurf did an ok job of creating html stubs for each one. I ended up still manually inspecting each one
            for having it look reasonable, and for making sense in the new organization of the website<label
                for="sn-organize" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-organize"
                class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">I no longer have a separate space for "Projects", and I now
                have more published papers. I decided to merge those two to reflect that I consider both a form of
                knowledge sharing</span>. The vibes were somewhat helpful in editing, but a lot of it was manual
            anyways. The most helpful was to go in and manually edit some things (mostly LaTeX delimiters, moving from
            "$" to "\(" and "\)"), and whichever base model I was using would pick up on it pretty quickly letting me
            tab through the rest of the changes. In the past I might have come up with a regex, but this saved some
            time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><span class="newthought">So did it help?</span> My best guess is that the total project took me about the
            same amount of time as it would have without "vibes". The most helpful bits were</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chatting about the overall design.</li>
            <li>Tweaking some css that I couldn't be bothered to care about.</li>
            <li>Creating some momentum that got me going on this.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            That last point actually reminds me of when I started learning <code>vim</code>: it makes me modestly faster
            at text editing, but mostly I find it is a fun little sidequest to keep my brain interested. I tried to use
            the LLM to take care of boring stuff, and it was modestly satisfying trying to get it to do that
            efficiently<label for="sn-vim" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
                id="sn-vim" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">When I want to navigate forward to a certain
                word in
                <code>vim</code>, trying to decide on <code>f+$LETTER</code> or <code>$Nw</code> does not really matter,
                but feels great when you really nail it. #hacker #vimlyfe #xtremewordprocessing</span>. </p>
