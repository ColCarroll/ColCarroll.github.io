            <p>I have been spending a lot of time with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/probability" target="_blank">TensorFlow Probability</a> in the last year in working on PyMC4 and generally doing <em>Bayesian things</em>. One feature that I have not seen emphasized - but I find very cool - is that chains are practically free, meaning running hundreds or thousands of chains is about as expensive as running 1 or 4.</p>

            <p>A <em>chain</em> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49825216/what-is-a-chain-in-pymc3/49836257#49836257" target="_blank">is an independent run of MCMC</a>. Running multiple chains can help diagnose multimodality (as in the linked answer), and allows for <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/rhat_ess/rhat_ess.html" target="_blank">convergence diagnostics</a>.</p>

The left plot is a histogram from each of the four chains, and the right is a timeseries of the 1,000 draws for each of the chains.

            <p>I have always seen libraries</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Implement an MCMC sampler, and then</li>
                <li>Use some sort of multiprocessing library to repeat it multiple times.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>For example, PyMC3 used to use <a href="https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">joblib</a>, and now uses <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/3011" target="_blank">a custom implementation</a>. So if you have 4 cores, you will run 4 independent chains in about the same amount of time as a single chain, or 100 independent chains in ~25x the amount of time as a single chain.</p>

            <figure>

                <img src="/img/sampling.png" alt="By default, PyMC3 will run one chain for each core available. This used 4 cores to sample 4 chains, and did it in less than a second." />

            <p>The above is pretty nice, but maybe we can do better. If you write an algorithm for &ldquo;MCMC with multiple chains&rdquo; as a vectorized routine, then instead of running your algorithm for &ldquo;MCMC&rdquo; multiple times, you can run &ldquo;MCMC with multiple chains&rdquo; once. Hopefully the linear algebra you used gives you performance gains, too.</p>

            <p>In a very hand-wavy way, we go from</p>

            <pre><code>usual_version = [run_mcmc(iters) for _ in range(chains)]
</code></pre>

            <p>to</p>

            <pre><code>vectorized_version = run_mcmc(iters, chains)
</code></pre>

            <h2 id="what-can-we-do-with-thousands-of-chains">What can we do with thousands of chains?</h2>

            <p>I am actually not sure! My impression is that there is low-hanging fruit here, but there are a couple places I have seen or found thousands of chains to be useful.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>I have been playing with <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03625" target="_blank">unbiased MCMC with couplings</a> recently. What does it mean for MCMC to be unbiased? Recall that MCMC is only <em>asymptotically</em> from the stationary distribution, so if a chain is not initialized properly, the mean will be biased (discarding some burn-in/warmup draws helps). We can see this by plotting the mean of thousands of (finite-length) chains:
                        <img src="/img/biased_mcmc.png" alt="png" /></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>In the very interesting <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03704" target="_blank">NeuTra-Lizing Bad Geometry in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Using Neural Transport</a>, the authors use thousands of chains in the experiments to report estimates of the algorithm&rsquo;s performance:</p>

                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            For all HMC experiments we used the corresponding q(Î¸) as the initial distribution. In all cases, we ran the 16384 chains for 1000 steps to compute the bias and chain diagnostics, and ran with 4096 chains to compute steps/second.
                        </blockquote>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>It seems like there is something useful to be done with <a href="https://colcarroll.github.io/hmc_tuning_talk/" target="_blank">tuning MCMC algorithms</a>. For example, step size adaptation is a one dimensional stochastic optimization problem, and may be able to be &ldquo;solved&rdquo; with grid search: choose a heuristic upper and lower bound on the step size, run a few iterations with step size <code>tf.linspace(lower, upper, num_chains)</code>, and then choose the optimal step size.</p>

            <p><strong>TensorFlow Probability</strong> Here is <a href="https://gist.github.com/ColCarroll/17c7fb6da0b8e3a32996ffa3c8826d46" target="_blank">a gist</a> showing how to run Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in TensorFlow Probability with 256 chains.</p>

            <p><strong>Numpy</strong> I have included a complete <code>numpy</code> implementation of a Metropolis-Hastings sampler at the end of this post, to give a taste of what it looks like (it is about 20 lines of code).</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="how-free-is-it">How free is it?</h2>

            <p>In each experiment, I took 1,000 samples from a standard Gaussian using 4 chains, and from 1,024 chains. This means 256 times as many samples.</p>

            <p><strong>TensorFlow Probability</strong> was using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and took 18.2 seconds vs 22.4 seconds (1.2x as long). I have done some experiments where this is ~10x faster with XLA compilation.</p>

            <p><strong>Numpy Implementation</strong> is below, and uses Metropolis-Hastings, so we expect it to be faster. It took 17.5ms vs 152ms (8.7x as long).</p>

            <p>Keep an eye out for massive numbers of chains, or for ways to use lots of chains. I think there is some interesting work to do here!</p>

# Correlated Gaussian

proposal_cov = np.eye(dim)
iters = 2_000
chains= 1_024
init = np.zeros(dim)

samples = metropolis_hastings_vec(log_prob, proposal_cov, iters, chains, init)
