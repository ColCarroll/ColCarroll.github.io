            <p>In an effort to show how <a href="https://mediacloud.org/" target="_blank">Media Cloud</a> can be used in simple open source
                projects, I <a href="https://github.com/colcarroll/seen_it_news" target="_blank">built a twitter bot</a> this weekend. The
                premise is that the twitter bot <a href="https://twitter.com/NYT_first_said" target="_blank">@NYT_first_said</a> tweets
                words whenever the New York Times uses them for the first time. My bot,
                <a href="https://twitter.com/seen_it_news" target="_blank">@seen_it_news</a>, searches a bunch of English language news
                sources (Washington Post, Wall St. Journal, USA Today, FOX News, among others) for uses of the word,
                and replies.</p>

            <p>
                <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
                    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Wall Street Journal was saying &quot;rewirement&quot; for 4 years before the New York Times did:<a href="https://t.co/O69rt0M3oh">https://t.co/O69rt0M3oh</a></p>&mdash; Hipster Media (@seen_it_news) <a href="https://twitter.com/seen_it_news/status/957010609572405248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2018</a>
                </blockquote>
                <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            </p>

            <p>It was a fun little project! I would love if the Media Cloud API could
                <a href="https://github.com/berkmancenter/mediacloud/issues/214" target="_blank">look up sources by url</a> so this could
                be entirely automated, but one cannot be too picky! <a href="https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy" target="_blank">Tweepy</a> was
                a joy to work with, as was <a href="https://github.com/kensho-technologies/grift" target="_blank">grift</a>, which was
                open-sourced at my previous company.</p>

            <p>Anyways, give the bot a follow! My favorite discovery was that &ldquo;metoo&rdquo; was first used three years
                ago by USA Today, as an answer
                <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/strauss/2015/08/17/strauss-small-business-quiz/31754211/" target="_blank">in a quiz about the original name of Yahoo</a>!</p>
