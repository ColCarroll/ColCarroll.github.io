                <blockquote>
                    "There is not a publicly available source of cross country result data."
                </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Short version:</strong> tfrrs.org will send you terrifying
                letters if you try to analyze cross country data, and the USTFCCCA is ok
                with this.</p>
            <p><strong>What you can do:</strong> Communicate with people like they
                are humans. Especially if they share an interest in something you’re
                passionate about. Also, <a href="http://localhost:8000/#/about">email
                    me</a> if you know of publicly available cross country results!</p>
            <p><strong>Long version:</strong> The <a href="http://www.ustfccca.org/">USTFCCCA</a> (“U.S. Track &amp; Field
                and Cross Country Coaches Association”, who lost their ampersand-related
                nerve halfway through the naming process) has some sort of relationship
                with <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/">tfrrs.org</a> ( “Track &amp; Field
                Results Reporting System”), providing them with cross country results.
                tfrrs.org does a fantastic job putting all these results into one place,
                and mostly in a consistent format. It is hard to find a popular
                organization that does not encourage people doing interesting things
                with their data: just in sports, the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/stats/">NHL</a>, <a href="http://stats.nba.com/">NBA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/baseballhackday/data-and-resources/wiki/Resources-and-ideas">MLB</a>,
                <a href="http://developer.sportradar.com/files/indexFootball.html#ncaa-football-api">NCAA
                    football</a>, and <a href="http://developer.sportradar.com/files/indexBasketball.html#daily-schedule45">NCAA
                    basketball</a> have public apis encouraging non-commercial uses. The
                running app Strava also provides a <a href="https://strava.github.io/api/">great looking api</a> for public
                use. I used the tfrrs.org results to make predictions about upcoming
                races, and they were as or more accurate than those published by more
                dedicated publishers of running news.</p>
            <p>The project was open source, had a small static website to display
                some of the analysis, and I was getting an average of 1 visitor per day,
                who I can only assume was lost. I made no money off the project for any
                number of reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No one but me was interested in it.</li>
                <li>I already have a day job.</li>
                <li>They weren’t my results.</li>
                <li>I was using <a href="http://trueskill.org/">a very cool library from
                        Microsoft</a> that prohibits commercial use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any case, the CEO of TFRRS sent me a cease and desist letter,
                which you can read at the bottom. The deleted tweet was a link to my
                site, and the text “Cross country analytics! /”. I complied with all of
                his demands because I have other things to worry about, but made this
                page because I think this is a disgusting reaction to a fan.</p>
            <p>As a followup, I emailed Tom Lewis, the Director of Media,
                Broadcasting and Analytics at the USTFCCCA asking if there is any public
                access to results.</p>
            <p>His reply:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Subject: Re: Access to results?</p>
                <p>Hi Colin,</p>
                <p>No, there is not a publicly available source of cross country result
                    data.</p>
